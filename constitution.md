# TOKIN is Born

> We hereby enact a public agreement incorporating the living entity known as TOKIN, bound by the laws of the land and free to operate on all levels of jurisdiction. In doing so, we cahoot characteristics enabling TOKIN to survive as an organism begotten into this time-space.

## Purpose

To create a game that benefits networks by normalizing communication points between players in a community and provide transparent, playful guidance on mutual benefits between users. Networks can include ecosystems, governments, markets, communities, and organizations of data or data points.

## Assembly

The TOKIN Assembly consists of the core-components, and proxies for subcomponents, players, and investors. Components are entities voted into, and out of, the Assembly by a ¾ majority of core-components. Additions and retractions to this founder agreement are applied to appendices by a ⅔ majority of core-components.

There are no limitations to number of components but upon minimum of 4 components, there must be a prime component and a chief component -- both of which are voted in by the core-components or wrestling to the tap if a draw persists after 3 voting rounds.

## Operations

The Assembly makes other decisions through a majority vote, where the chief component has an extra vote. Subcomponents are subcontractors who contribute to TOKIN systems. Active subcomponents, investors, and players may elect a single representative component, a proxy . The prime component may break ties and distribute votes of components who abstain or are otherwise incapacitated.

Votes are scheduled by agreement between prime and chief components or by ¾ majority of components, must be held in real-time after closing conversations on the topic, and follows the rules of order in Appendix 1.

The chief component creates contracts, disperses funds, and helps active components be accountable for quality and timeliness of performance.

## Equitable Value

The matrix of value distributes equity to the founding, passive, and active components based on the worth of liquefiable TOKIN assets at a given moment, taking into account effort and effect of contributing components, subtracting contractual obligations. The remainder value is evaluated using the TOKIN system recursively to calculate the substance of contributions in light of current and projected assets. This provides real-time fluctuations in a natural equity split.

Value is shared between manifestations and equity. Manifestations are physical distributions of goods or transfers of equity for assets exterior to TOKIN and offset a core-component’s current equity share in the matrix, normalized against the total value of equity with TOKIN’s liquefiable assets at time of transfer.
