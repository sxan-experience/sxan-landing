# Tokin Whitepaper

> _The purpose of pursuit_

[[toc]]

## Overview

We offer a digital platform for self-awareness by analyzing activities in specific networks, communities, and purpose groups. Tokin is introduced as a GAME to engage and retain players for the betterment of the players and the groups they contribute towards.

Players join networks they care about because gameplay with purpose amongst peers gives validated reputations, trusted transactions, and transparent recognition of achievements.

::: tip Benefits

* Challenges reveal latent and obvious opportunities in a fun, rewarding format

* Dialogs with bot coaches increase self-awareness for the players and the groups

* Immutability enhances protection from mistakes, bad actors, and unforeseen situations

* Fair Play decentralizes power structures to create meritocratic, equal advancement.
  :::

## Mission & Values

The difference between mob mentality and democracy is separated by a thin veil of education and intention. On one side of the veil is ignorance, a trait humans have an innate, natural affinity for. The other side is awareness, a trait that takes hard work and vigilance to realize consistently.

Manipulators enjoy open-access to our hopes and dreams. They latch-on unnoticed through subtle channels, but they must be invited in by the dreamer! With awareness, a dreamer obliterates the effect of bad actors.

### Social Impact

In a world of general social networks, it’s hard to determine the true quality of community members. By isolating purpose groups in their own networks, Tokin provides a superb layer of reputation management and meaningful connections, validated by the purpose group, to support the shared goals of people and teams.

This self-curated data is easier to aggregate, normalize, process, and analyze to return actionable insights to players in a feedback loop. Tokin consists of various machine learning strategies, both supervised and unsupervised. Certain benefits realized from this loop include rating systems for activities, personalities, biases, and detection of bad actors.

People like fun. People like achieving. The evolution of Tokin brought us to the realization people prefer accomplishing their goals within a supportive framework of a GAME. Unlike others with similar rhetoric and “gamified” veneers -- we’ve built Tokin from a foundation of true game-mechanics and purpose to encourage open, real-world collaborations between players and maximize the quality of these engagements.

Finally, we introduce the concept of Flexuity, or flexible equity. Like the volatile nature of ethereal currencies in real-time, a player receives rewards and voting power relative to the efforts and effects of all other players in the networks. This results in leadership that’s decentralized, trusted, and meritocratic.

### Advancing Technologies

#### GraphChain

> Tokin uses Erlang/OTP! to provide a robust and future-facing immutable DAG ledger. This implementation allows child-chain creation and thoughtful rules for child-chain merging. A further advantage of a graph over linear blockchains is the opportunity to apply data-science towards the relationships, qualities, and patterns of connections.

#### Smart Contract

> System built for 2-way functionality, i.e. push notifications and pull responses. Each network transaction has pub/sub capabilities enabled allowing for humans and bots to act upon conditions in the network, over any specified timeframe, with incentives baked into the network to cover processing costs. These functions form the basis for every engagement in the game, including transactions.

#### Hash and Stash

> Although PGP privacy (public/private keys, signing certificates) is pretty good, it’s obviously susceptible to forms of phishing and cracking. We’ve developed a protocol to add adjustable levels of complexity through simple maths and common sense.

::: warning The logic of trust in Tokin systems presents players with options to balance speed and integrity.
Some transactions may be public with zero-risk, propagate through the network at top speed using trustless verifications. More sensitive transactions propagate with enhanced levels of security via the Lock and Stash mechanism, taking more time to propagate to better preserve confidentiality.
:::

#### Zippering

> Re-incorporate children chains into the main chain with full accounting of fundamentals and value trajectories. With Zippering, there is no lost value upon organizational dissolution and, after being sufficiently proven on a child chain, tech updates become adopted into the main chain.

#### GDN (Graphchain Delivery Network)

> Pruning is a blockchain mechanism where space is saved by removing seemingly useless blockchain data. There are inherent dangers with pruning blockchains because it arbitrarily manipulates the ledger, creating a greater possibility for fraud. However, reversing the pruning concept and applying content delivery network thinking gives us a unique advantage. Instead of pruning the dead weight, the network optimizes parts of the Graphchain keep the most relevant connections on the closest fastest caches, by time and location to a player. This is still open to dangers, so the network can take the long road for additional verifications but most activities will benefit.

#### BlockTrain

> Addressing the problem of growing data by sending concerted data around an immutable circuit like trains on a track. Instead of each node replicating the entire Graphchain, the system sends data across the network in redundant cycles so that nodes never hold the entire chain, only fragments as they arrive and depart the node station. Quickly and accurately determines where the data is at a given moment and handles real-time network traffic considerations, i.e. dealing with bottlenecks or deactivated resources. Network nodes can keep as much of the GraphChain they wish but most will opt-in to the BlockTrain protocol.

## Economic Freedoms

Players replace the need for financial middleware or 3rd-party identity verification. There is no need for banks, governments, or OAUTH providers. Player identities are verified once, then added to the graphchain with the highest level of security.
::: tip Tokens
Coins - **Tik** ,**Tok**: 1,000 Tiks to a Tok. This widget's price is 5 _Toks_ and 350 _Tiks_. I'll trade 15 _Tok_ for $225 fiat.

Keys - **Oki**: You can't post hustles until discovering the _Hustle Oki_ after level 100. Did you get the _Oki_ for my birthday party?

Shares - **Kin**: the players own 100% of the company's reserve _Kin_. My 1200 _Kin_ delivered 300 _Toks_ into my account this month.

### Accessibility

Anyone can play and build Tokin. coins are rewarded in the game as achievement rewards. coins will also be paired on exchanges and we’ll include Atomic Swap technology soon.

purpose groups choose the level of authentication necessary for operation. Players can stay anonymous in the meta-Tokin network (those building Tokin) or other groups with minimum identity requirements. Players have the ability to earn coins regardless of where or who they are, without the ability to interact in groups who demand higher levels of authentication.

### Decentralization

The network and protocols are open-source technologies with improvements to continually innovate as needed. Any cloud provider or private device can participate by running our server node. Available for Linux, OSX, iOS, and Android. Although anyone can fork the technology, it benefits almost all players and groups to contribute to the main network.

::: tip Tokin systems are optimized to scale.
The bigger the network, the faster the transactions, and better the ability to prevent double-spend or catch other cheats.

## Consensus

### Legislation

Topics of interest to discuss are detected by bots and delivered to interested players to escalate to their yeoman. Players vote whether any generated topics are important to them, and results are tallied to check if it’s an issue across networks or local to specific networks.

If it’s a local issue, the purpose group is free to legislate internally according to their own rules. If the issue is global, then it falls under the jurisdiction of the Assembly. Decisions are made by the Assembly -- a consensus of players and bots.

### Parts of the Assembly

* Components - Total Votes: All players / 2 (33.333%)  
  Entities voted into the Assembly by a ¾ majority of purpose group delegates and nominated by the Yeoman. Additions and retractions to this founder agreement are applied to appendices by a ⅔ majority of the Core. The Core can vote on possible courses of action and has votes equal to half the total number of players in all purpose groups.

- Delegates - Total Votes: All players in purpose group / 1 + 1 (66.667%)  
  Each purpose group chooses 1-3 delegates to the Assembly. Delegates also vote on decisions. Each purpose group has one vote per verified player in their group, evenly divided among the representative delegates.

- Yeomen - Total Votes: 0  
  The Yeomen are direct representatives of players. They have no Assembly votes and are the only Assembly members who can prioritize problems to discuss. For every 9 players across all networks, a sub-yeoman is randomly assigned. Then all sub-yeomen conduct a run-off vote for 3 sub-yeomen to become Yeomen.

## Blockchain type

We remixed a fractal Graphchain using Erlang/Elixer with a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) ETS database architecture.

Instead of a linear blockchain, this Graphchain gives the network powers and options to best achieve various goals and outcomes. Our implementation is best thought of as an immutable library covered in a decentralized nervous system.

## Protocols

::: warning Lock and Stash

A node first encrypts some content, slices the encrypted content into data chunks, then inserts these chunks into random blobs on the Graphchain, and finally sends the map of chunk locations to the intended audience. The sender provides a private key, via a separate channel or node, to the audience. The audience can only receive the content if they have both the map and private key.

::: warning qBitcoin

(upcoming implementation)

Quantum-proofing the chains by incorporating mechanisms for changing the public or private keys whenever content is viewed or updated.

## Proofs

### Proof of Random Stake

> Nodes who keep a minimum portion of coins on reserve are entered into a lottery for minting/mining. This is the basis for minting coins.

[INSERT GRAPHIC OF RANDOM STAKE]

### Proof of Shape

> Players and bots will often engage in repetitive behaviors with each behavior consisting of a handful of evident facts. These collected facts form a shape, distinguishable to provide a lightning-fast proof.

[INSERT GRAPHIC OF PROOF OF SHAPE]

Proof of Activity

> Each entry to the chain can latch itself to a past entry, increasing validation to that entry and creating a traceable family-tree of trusted activities.

[INSERT GRAPHIC OF PROOF OF ACTIVITY]

### Proof of Continuum

> Temporal signal-proofing strategy. Connections between n peers persistently stream bytes within deterministic patterns, such as _Morse Code_. This continuity stream is queried for validations, limited or extended as needs dictate, ultimately providing for instant trustless proofability.

## _ECONOMICS_

### Token Type

Erlang/Elixer, proprietary open-source build.

[INSERT GRAPHIC OF BLOCKCHAINS W/ FEATURES v. COMPETITIVE TECH]

### Token Utility

* coins are used to reward players in the game and nodes participating in the network. coins are primarily used to publish content and transact with other players or bots. coins may also be traded off-network.

* keys allow permissions in the game for certain activities, including but not limited to, publishing content, products, challenges, courses, and access to special events.

* shares are privately-traded shares in the company Tokin. In turn, the company is owned by a public trust made up of all players. Shares pay dividends via fiat currency. The Assembly creates, distributes, buys-back shares, and supervises refinement of the Flexuity algorithms for mitigating volatile external inflation/deflation, i.e. exchange and whale attacks.
